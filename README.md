# Arduino-Ornithopter

Bees are an essential to our survival because they are the primary pollinators in the world and they directly impact the success or failure of agriculture. However, with declining bee populations, people are slowly becoming aware about the complications that could arise and they are trying to find replacements for these important pollinators. The purpose of this research project is to develop, build, and test an ornithopter that can mimic the pollinating behavior of bees. Our code allows the ornithopter to function in two different modes. Hover mode allows the ornithopter to hover hands-free, with any acceleration in one direction being automatically countered with a corresponding acclereation from another direction. The manual mode allows for data to be sent to the flying ornithopter via an RF tranceiver to steer the ornithopter when it is not in hover mode. Although it is crucial we save the pollinators of the world, our ornithopter provides a solution to the reprecussions of a declining pollinator populationt a temporary Read Me
